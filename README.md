# FinanceLib

## Objectives
FinanceLib is a project I am working to deliver an Open Source platform for Back-Testing and Risk Management.

The code will be mainly written in F# (.NET Core) with examples of usage written both in F# and C#.

## Updates
For now the repository remains private as it is still in its very early stage but I hope to release some code here early July 2020!
